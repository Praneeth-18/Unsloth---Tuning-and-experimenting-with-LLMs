# LLM Use Cases and Fine-tuning

This repository contains various Colab notebooks demonstrating different use cases and techniques in fine-tuning and deploying large language models (LLMs) using a variety of frameworks and tools. Below is a summary of each task, including video explanations and links to the Colab notebooks.

## Tasks

### a) Fine-tuning

For each model, a unique task was demonstrated, explaining the process, input formats, and datasets used:

- **Llama 3.1 (8B)**: Fine-tuned for coding tasks using a specific dataset. The video explains the setup and execution.
- **Mistral NeMo (12B)**: Focused on casual conversation tasks. The process was detailed in a video tutorial.
- **Gemma 2 (9B)**: Demonstrated fine-tuning for chat applications with Hugging Face & SFT Trainer.
- **Phi-3.5 (mini)**: Fine-tuned using SFTTrainer and Accelerate for efficient memory usage.

### b) Continued Pretraining

Using Unsloth AI, we extended the model's capabilities by teaching it a new language. The steps included selecting a base model, preparing the dataset, and initializing pretraining.

### c) Chat Templates Colabs

Created templates for various chat applications:

- **Classification**: A model classifying user sentiments.
- **Conversational Chat**: Engaging in everyday discussions.
- **Extended Context Size**: Modified TinyLlama to handle larger context sizes.
- **Multi-dataset Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuned on multiple datasets concurrently.

### d) Reward Modeling

Implemented reward modeling using ORPO and DPO strategies. The process involved setting up the framework and evaluating performance.

### e) Continued Fine-tuning from Custom Checkpoint

Continued fine-tuning from a custom checkpoint to enhance model performance on specific tasks.

### f) Mental Health Chatbot Development

Fine-tuned Unsloth for developing a mental health chatbot, focusing on empathetic response generation.

### g) Export to Ollama

Demonstrated how to fine-tune a model with Unsloth and export it to Ollama for inference, showcasing the deployment process.
